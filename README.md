# CS50W
All that I did in [CS50W](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/).

Why does this exist?

This repo is for those who have finished the problem sets and want to see other peoples approach to problems and is NOT meant for those actively doing the problem sets. See CS50's [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/) to learn more.

And for me to look back at what I did in CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
